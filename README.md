Learning Management System 

### TO DO
==================================
* There will be courses. A course has many lessons. 
* Users can pay for a course and complete all lessons. 
* A lesson will have text and embedded vimeo videos. 
* The system should show a list of users currently working on a course (updated using Phoenix channels). 
* Users should be able to leave comments for a course (star rating 1..5, text input) and write comments to each other regarding a lesson they work on. Once a course is completed, a PDF certificate should be generated.
* Users should pay a one time fee for each course they decide to take. Stripe is used as the payment gateway.
